# Sainsburys Tech Test
### Matt Jewell - June 2016

 To get up and running. `npm install` to get set up. Then run the tests with `npm run-script test` or run the util itself with `npm run-script run`. Easy peasy.

 Solution is my own, so please don't attempt to pass anything off in here as your own work.
